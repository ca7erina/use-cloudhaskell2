-- The purpose of this project is to provide a baseline demonstration of the use of cloudhaskell in the context of the
-- code complexity measurement individual programming project. The cloud haskell platform provides an elegant set of
-- features that support the construction of a wide variety of multi-node distributed systems commuinication
-- architectures. A simple message passing abstraction forms the basis of all communication.
--
-- This project provides a command line switch for starting the application in master or worker mode. It is implemented
-- using the work-pushing pattern described in http://www.well-typed.com/blog/71/. Comments below describe how it
-- operates. A docker-compose.yml file is provided that supports the launching of a master and set of workers.
